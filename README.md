# Password Generator JavaScript Application

## Description
This project was a challenge assigned to us where we had to create a password generator from some starter code. The HTML and CSS was already completed and we were only given a small portion of JavaScript. When the button is clicked to Generate Password, then the user is prompted to choose how many characters they want between 8 and 128. The user is then asked if they would like to use lowercase characters, uppercase, numbers, and special characters, after which the password is displayed on the page.

JavaScript was not as clear to me as with previous challenges that were HTML and CSS based. I was faced with many issues starting out because the logic of JavaScript was not fully clicking yet and after spending many hours trying different lines of code, I was constantly getting errors. I then found out that the starter code that we were given had an error where a line of JavaScript was not in the correct place and needed to be moved to the bottom. After fixing the bug, I began to write prompt codes and continued to attempt functions but was not getting the result I wanted. I was able to get help from a tutor who guided me on how best to start and what I should change or get rid of. I still do not completely understand JavaScript yet but getting this help is moving me closer to understanding it.


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
