# Password Generator JavaScript Application

## Description
This project was a challenge assigned to us where we had to create a password generator from some starter code. The HTML and CSS was already completed and we were only given a small portion of JavaScript. When the button is clicked to Generate Password, then the user is prompted to choose how many characters they want between 8 and 128. The user is then asked if they would like to use lowercase characters, uppercase, numbers, and special characters, after which the password is displayed on the page.

JavaScript was not as clear to me as with previous challenges that were HTML and CSS based. I was faced with many issues starting out because the logic of JavaScript was not fully clicking yet and after spending many hours trying different lines of code, I was constantly getting errors. I then found out that the starter code that we were given had an error where a line of JavaScript was not in the correct place and needed to be moved to the bottom. After fixing the bug, I began to write prompt codes and continued to attempt functions but was not getting the result I wanted. I was able to get help from a tutor who guided me on how best to start and what I should change or get rid of. I still do not completely understand JavaScript yet but getting this help is moving me closer to understanding it.


## Usage
This project serves as a password generator that prompts on criteria they need for their password.
